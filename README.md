# Altruist QA Automation Exercise

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Altruist QA Automation Assessment.

The primary objective is to validate the list of stock symbols displayed in the "You may be interested in" section on [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance), compare them with a given set of expected symbols, and clearly report any extra or missing symbols. The solution demonstrates robust, production-quality UI automation with best practices.

## Notes

- The set of stock symbols shown in the UI is dynamic and may differ by user or time. This is handled gracefully in the test reporting.
- All logic, comments, and structure follow best practices for clarity and maintainability.
- If you have any trouble running the tests or would like to discuss the approach, please reach outâ€”happy to walk through the solution!
